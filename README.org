* earthspy

=earthspy= is a wrapper around methods for the download of satellite data offered in the [[https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinelhub-py][sentinelhub Python package]]. This tool makes the monitoring and study of any place on Earth simple, ready to use and easily deployable for operational purposes and NRT applications. Just like a spy!

Some useful capabilities: 
  - Data download in multiprocessing
  - Data download at optimized resolutions with the Direct Download (DD) method 
  - Data download at raw resolution with the Split and Merge Downlodad (SMD) method
  - Data storage with an efficient structure

As =earthspy= is built on top of the [[https://www.sentinel-hub.com/][Sentinel Hub services]], it includes e.g. the data pre-processing through [[https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/evalscript/][custom scripts]] allowing the user to process and download only the products needed (such as high-level indices) therefore optimizing download time and local storage.
